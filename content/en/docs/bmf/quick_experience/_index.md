In this section, we will directly showcase the capabilities of the BMF framework around five dimensions: **Transcode**, **Edit**, **Meeting/Broadcaster**, **CPU+GPU acceleration**, and **AI**. For all the demos provided below, corresponding implementations and documentation are available on Google Colab, allowing you to experience them intuitively.

### Transcode
This demo describes step-by-step how to use BMF to develop a transcoding program, including video transcoding, audio transcoding, and image transcoding. In it, you can familiarize yourself with how to use BMF and how to use FFmpeg-compatible options to achieve the capabilities you need.

If you want to have a quick experiment, you can try it on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BabitMF/bmf/blob/master/bmf/demo/transcode/bmf_transcode_demo.ipynb)

### Edit
The Edit Demo will show you how to implement a high-complexity audio and video editing pipeline through the BMF framework. We have implemented two Python modules, video_concat and video_overlay, and combined various atomic capabilities to construct a complex BMF Graph.

### Meeting/Broadcaster
This demo uses BMF framework to construct a simple broadcast service. The service provides an API that enables dynamic video source pulling, video layout control, audio mixing, and ultimately streaming the output to an RTMP server. This demo showcases the modularity of BMF, multi-language development, and the ability of dynamically adjusting the pipeline.

Below is a screen recording demonstrating the operation of broadcaster:

### CPU+GPU acceleration

#### Video Frame Extraction
The video frame extraction acceleration demo shows:
1. BMF flexible capability of:

   *   Multi-language programming，we can see multi-language module work together in the demo
   *   Ability extend easily, there are new C++, Python modules added simply
   *   FFmpeg ability fully compatible

2. Hardware acceleration quickly enablement and CPU/GPU pipeline support

   *   Heterogeneous pipeline is supported in BMF, such as process between CPU and GPU
   *   Usefull hardware color space convertion in BMF

#### GPU Video Processing

The GPU transcoding and filter module demo shows:
1. Common video/image filters in BMF accelerated by GPU
2. How to write GPU modules in BMF

The demo builds a transcoding pipeline which fully runs on GPU:

decode->scale->flip->rotate->crop->blur->encode

### AI

#### Deoldify

This demo shows the how to integrate the state of art AI algorithms into the BMF video processing pipeline. The famous open source colorization algorithm [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) is wrapped as an BMF pyhton module in less than 100 lines of codes. The final effect is illustrated below, with the original video on the left side and the colored video on the right.

#### Supper Resolution
This demo implements the super-resolution inference process of [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) as a BMF module, showcasing a BMF pipeline that combines decoding, super-resolution inference and encoding.

#### Video Quality Score

This demo shows how to invoke our aesthetic assessment model using bmf. Our deep learning model Aesmode has achieved a binary classification accuracy of 83.8% on AVA dataset, reaching the level of academic SOTA, and can be directly used to evaluate the aesthetic degree of videos by means of frame extraction processing.

#### Face Detect With TensorRT

This Demo shows a full-link face detect pipeline based on TensorRT acceleration, which internally uses the TensorRT-accelerated Onnx model to process the input video, and uses the NMS algorithm to filter repeated candidate boxes to form an output, which can be used to efficiently process a Face Detection Task.
